# Student Project Team Builder

SPTB is a social networking platform designed to make it easier for university students to group up and tackle side-projects throughout their studies.

The project consists of a server-side made up of a RESTful API and a relational database. The API was built with Django and Django Rest Framework, and PostgreSQL was the database of choice. The client-side of the project consists of a Single Page Application (SPA) built with React JS.
