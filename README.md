# Student Project Team Builder

This is a social networking web application that I developed for my final year project at university. It demonstrates a university-wide platform built for finding and forming groups for project collaboration, intended to encourage students to collaborate with others on side projects to complement their academic studies.

Students can log in with their university credentials to access the application. They can create a project hub, where they can specify the details of the project, what roles they are looking to fill, and participate in team or public discussions. 

The application has search capabilities, where students can search for other student accounts or projects based on roles (e.g., Software Engineer or Graphic Designer).

There is an invitation system that enables project owners to invite other students to join their project hub, or students can request to join other teams.

## Backend
The backend of this application consists of a REST API and a relational database, built by using Django, Django Rest Framework, and PostgreSQL.

## Frontend
The frontend of this application consists of a Single Page Application (SPA) that was built using React JS.
It involved use of libraries such as Material UI, Formik, Axios, and React Router. The application was end-to-end tested using Cypress.
